# TECHOTSAV
This is a whole front end and backend source code for my project in webkriti contest.I have used NODEJS,JAVASCRIPT,HTML,PARTICLEJS,CSS,MYSQL to build this app.



# FEATURES
# Front End:
* Use of particlejs library in the background
* Responsiveness in CORE TEAM page
* Use of Keyframes and Webkit animation to style the heading
* Use of JAVASCRIPT to build the security aspect in my sign up form
* Flex box to display buttons on the homepage
* Colour animation for TED TALKS and ACCOMODATION buttons
* A Photo Gallery using JAVASCRIPT at the bottom of home page
* Social media icons at the bottom of every page
* Techotsav symbol at the top-right corner of every page which by clicking would redirect to the home page

# Backend and Security:
* Redirecting to Login Form if not yet logged in but performing operations like REGISTER,UNREGISTER or to view DASHBOARD
* Use of EJS templating engine to display dashboard by rendering data dynamically(THANKS TO AASF BLOG-3 on NODEJS
* DISPLAYING MEMES if he/she tried to register even though they had already registered,unregister if they didn't register in the first place ,tried to log-in even though they are already logged-in ,tried to log out even though they are already logged out or incorrect email or password in login page
* Redirecting to the dashborard after the log-in is succesfull
* Redirecting to the dashboard after registering/unregistering for any event or booking for accomodation(which would turn to YES)
